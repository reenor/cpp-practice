Q: A derived class's constructor explicitly invokes its base class's constructor, but a derived class's destructor cannot invoke its base class's destructor.
Why does this apparent asymmetry make sense?
A: Destructors are automatically invoked when an object goes out of scope or when a dynamically allocated object is deleted. Inheritance does not change this behavior. This is the reason a derived destructor cannot invoke its base class's destructor.
